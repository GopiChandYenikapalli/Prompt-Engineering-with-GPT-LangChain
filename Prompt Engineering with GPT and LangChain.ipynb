It has many capabilities, some of which will not be introduced until later modules, but we will start with a gentle introduction to some of the easy-to-understand concepts in the framework.\n\nYou'll build an AI agent that uses Python and GPT to perform sentiment analysis on financial headlines.\n\nIn more detail, you'll cover:\n- Getting set up with an OpenAI developer account and integration with Workspace.\n- Interacting with OpenAI models through the langchain framework.\n- Using prompt templates that write reusable, dynamic prompts.\n- Working with LLM chains.\n- Automatically parsing the output of an LLM to be used downstream.\n- Working with langchain agents and tools.\n- Using the OpenAI Moderation API to filter explicit content.\n\nFor this project, we are using two small samples: `financial_headlines.txt` and `reddit_comments.txt`. These 5-6 line samples are kept short to keep evaluation easy, but keep in mind that this same code and prompt engineering techniques can scale to datasets of much larger size.","metadata":{},"id":"9a610d9c-089e-4b41-803d-17024f68c51a","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"### Before you begin","metadata":{},"id":"9358e4e8-7bba-4f77-a4c1-80a49c57869e","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"You'll need a developer account with OpenAI.\n\nSee getting-started.ipynb for steps on how to create an API key and store it in Workspace.

It is a system composed of a set of modules, often accompanied by an agent that decides how to route prompts to the appropriate module (or tools).\n\nThese kinds of prompts follow a specific format, which we can force the GPT-model to adhere to by using the system message. It will loop through this format (steps 1-5 below) using recursive requests to the GPT-model until we get our final answer. A commonly used format is the following:\n1. Question: the user question (in the first iteration) or follow-up question composed by the GPT-models (in later iterations)\n2. Thought: think about what to do as a next step\n3. Action: pick a tool from the list of tool names we have provided\n4. Action Input: the input for the chosen tool\n5. Observation: the output of the tool","metadata":{},"id":"c8f4e729-a8e9-4d28-bc3f-752cb3efc620","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"### What are Tools and Agents?\n\nWe can access (external) tools using the output of the GPT-model. Large language models output only text. In order to call a function (to access a tool) based on the text output of a large language model, we can use agents. They can parse the text output, pick the correct tool and define its input.\n\nThe langchain framework has a wide variety of built-in tools, along with the ability to define additional custom tools. A very common use case for tools is accessing document stores or vector databases to ingest information from our own documents. This will be explored more in-depth in future modules.\n\nFor now, to have a gentle introduction to tools, we have decided on one that does not require external set up (no API token that needs to be created or external database that needs to be set up). \n\nIn this example, we will make use of the `PythonREPLTool`. This allows the GPT-model to run the Python code that it generates, and can be useful for carrying out an abundance of tasks.\n\nNote: as we introduce recursive prompts using agents, it is best practice to always define a maximum number of output tokens. This ensures our costs will not skyrocket if a prompt loop takes too long.","metadata":{},"id":"709a8d80-fb26-4f83-9cf2-19e6cbb00557","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"### Instructions\n\nBefore we continue with our financial analysis, let's create a quick example of how code can be ran using a Python agent.
